This application was created from the create-react-app script, and demonstrates how to integrate the AWS Cognito hosted / built in sign-in and sign-up UI content with a React application. See my article [AWS Cognito example using React UI and Node.js REST APIs â€” part 2 (React UI app with Redux)](https://medium.com/@arron.harden/aws-cognito-example-using-react-ui-and-node-js-rest-apis-part-3-jwt-secured-rest-apis-e56d336ce306) for more information.

## Cognito setup notes

- I had to create an App client with no secret key, otherwise I got a [`invalid_client`](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-auth-js/issues/206) exception.
- App client settings require `Authorization code grant` and `email`, `openid`, `profile`, and (optionally) `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`.

## Running the application

These instructions assume you are running both Metabase and this demo app locally. As they both run on port 3000 by default, we'll make this app run on port 3001.

1. Get Metabase running and enable JWT
    - Use `http://localhost:3001` as the Identity Provider URI
2. Modify `src/config/app-config.json` to match your user pool and application URLs.
    - When running locally, the `signoutUri` will need to be `http://localhost:3000/` and the `callbackUri` property will need to be `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
    - Use the JWT Signing Key from from your Metabase settings (http://localhost:3000/admin/settings/authentication/jwt) as the `metabaseSecret`
3. Run `npm install` to setup and install the dependencies.
4. Run `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider PORT=3001 npm start` to start the application.
5. A browser session should automatically open, pointing at `http://localhost:3001`.
6. Click "Sign In"!

## JWT secured REST API service
This application will attempt to invoke a simple example REST API using the JWT access code returned in the callback from Cognito. See the repo at https://github.com/arronharden/cognito-demo-service for the implementation of this REST API. A running instance of this REST API is hosted at https://cognito-demo-api.arronharden.com.
